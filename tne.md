# The New Economy
The New Economy, TNE, is the ultimate economy plugin for your Minecraft server, no matter what platform you're on. While
TNE is pushed as being "feature-packed," it's not feature packed in the normal sense of jamming a bunch of useless features
into the core plugin, but rather using modules.

# About TNE
TNE was originally created for hey0's hMod long before Bukkit/Spigot/Paper was a thing. Since then, it has taken on many
forms and this is the future form of the plugin. This core is designed to be robust and carry TNE into the future with or
without Minecraft by not being platform-dependent.

# Why TNE?

## Platform Agnostic
Use TNE on the platform you want!
- Sponge? Sure
- Spigot/Paper? Definitely!
- Use both? We support cross-server balances on both. That's right, you can send money from your Spigot server to your
Sponge Server!

## Features
Want minimal Features? Why not! Want all the features? That's an option too!

I believe that server owners should be able to have options, and that's the premise behind TNE. While many features are
offered, they're all optional. If you don't want any additional features, and just want a simple economy then you can elect
to not download and install them, it's as easy as that!

## API Support
TNE offers support for Vault, which lets any third-party plugin hook into your economy and add additional functionality.

Key Supported Plugins:
- Factions
- Towny

## Easy to Use
TNE has been recoded with ease-of-use in mind. This means whether you're a power user who loves your YAML files, or a
casual user who wants Menu-based interactions, TNE is right for you!

## Free as in Freedom, not Free as in Beer
[TNE is licensed under the AGPLv3](license.md), which means you're free to use it how you want. This also means that
networks that add improvements to their version must also provide them for everyone else to enjoy!

## Documented
TNE has lots of documentation for the power users that like all the documentation.
